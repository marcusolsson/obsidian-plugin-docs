# Vault

From the official documentation on [Working with multiple Vaults](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults):

> Each collection of notes in Obsidian is known as a Vault. A Vault consists of a folder, and any sub-folders within it.

While your plugin can access the file system like any other Node.js application, the [`Vault`](../api/classes/Vault.md) module aims to make it easier to work with files and folders within a Vault.

The following example recursively prints the paths of all Markdown files in a Vault:

```ts
const files = this.app.vault.getMarkdownFiles()

for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
  console.log(files[i].path);
}
```

:::tip
If you want to list _all_ files, and not just Markdown documents, use [`getFiles()`](../api/classes/Vault.md#getfiles) instead.

## Read files

There are two methods for reading the content of a file: [`read()`](../api/classes/Vault.md#read) and [`cachedRead()`](../api/classes/Vault.md#cachedread).

- If you only want to display the content to the user, then use `cachedRead()` to avoid reading the file from disk multiple times.
- If you want to read the content, change it, and then write it back to disk, then use `read()` to avoid potentially overwriting the file with a stale copy.

:::info
The only difference between `cachedRead()` and `read()` is when the file was modified outside of Obsidian just before the plugin reads it. As soon as the file system notifies Obsidian that the file has changed from the outside, `cachedRead()` behaves _exactly_ like `read()`. Similarly, if you save the file within Obsidian, the read cache is flushed as well.
:::

The following example reads the content of all Markdown files in the Vault and returns the average document size:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { Notice, Plugin } from "obsidian";

export default class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
  async onload() {
    this.addRibbonIcon("info", "Calculate average file length", async () => {
      const fileLength = await this.averageFileLength();
      new Notice(`The average file length is ${fileLength} characters.`);
    });
  }

  async averageFileLength(): Promise<number> {
    const { vault } = this.app;

    const fileContents: string[] = await Promise.all(
      vault.getMarkdownFiles().map((file) => vault.cachedRead(file))
    );

    let totalLength = 0;
    fileContents.forEach((content) => {
      totalLength += content.length;
    });

    return totalLength / fileContents.length;
  }
}
```

## Delete files

There are two methods to delete a file, [`delete()`](../api/classes/Vault.md#delete), and [`trash()`](../api/classes/Vault.md#trash). Which one you should use depends on if you want to allow the user to change their mind.

- `delete()` removes the file without a trace.
- `trash()` moves the file to the trash bin.

When you use `trash()`, you have the option to move the file to the system's trash bin, or to a local  `.trash` folder at the root of the user's Vault.

## Is it a file or folder?

Some operations return or accept a [`TAbstractFile`](../api/classes/TAbstractFile.md) object, which can be either a file or a folder. Always check the concrete type of a `TAbstractFile` before you use it.

```ts
const folderOrFile = this.app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath("folderOrFile");

if (folderOrFile instanceof TFile) {
  console.log("It's a file!");
} else if (folderOrFile instanceof TFolder) {
  console.log("It's a folder!");
}
```
