# Release your plugin with GitHub Actions

Manually creating your plugin release can be time-consuming and error-prone. In this guide, you'll configure your plugin to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically create a release when you create a new tag.

:::note
The GitHub Action workflow was originally created and shared by [argentum](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/argentum). For more information and other variations, refer to the [forum announcement](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-github-actions-to-release-plugins/7877/3).
:::

1. In the root directory of your plugin, create a file called `release.yml` under `.github/workflows` with the following content:

   ```yml title=".github/workflows/release.yml"
   name: Release Obsidian plugin

   on:
     push:
       tags:
         - "*"

   env:
     PLUGIN_NAME: your-plugin-id # Change this to match the id of your plugin.

   jobs:
     build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          with:
            fetch-depth: 0 # otherwise, you will failed to push refs to dest repo
        - name: Use Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: "18.x" # You might need to adjust this value to your own version.

        # Get the version number and put it in an environment file
        - name: Get Version
          id: version
          run: |
            echo "tag=$(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))" >> $GITHUB_ENV

        # Build the plugin
        - name: Build
          id: build
          run: |
            npm install
            npm run build

        # Package the required files into a zip
        - name: Package
          run: |
            mkdir ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
            cp main.js manifest.json styles.css README.md ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
            zip -r ${{ github.event.repository.name }}-${{ env.tag }}.zip ${{ github.event.repository.name }}

        - name: Release
          uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
          with:
            files: |
              ${{ github.event.repository.name }}-${{ env.tag }}.zip
              main.js
              main.css
              manifest.json
              styles.css

   ```

1. In your terminal, commit the workflow.

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/release.yml
   git commit -m "Add release workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

1. Create a tag that matches the version in the `manifest.json` file.

   ```bash
   git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "1.0.1"
   git push origin 1.0.1
   ```

   - `-a` creates an [annotated tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging#_creating_tags).
   - `-m` specifies the name of your release. For Obsidian plugins, this must be the same as the version.

1. Browse to your repository on GitHub and click the **Actions** tab. Your workflow might still be running, or it might have finished already.

1. When the workflow finishes, go back to the main page for your repository and click **Releases** in the side bar on the right-hand side. The workflow has created a GitHub release and uploaded the required assets as binary attachments.

You've set up your plugin to automatically create a GitHub release whenever you create a new tag.

- If this is the first release for this plugin, you're now ready to [submit your plugin](submit-your-plugin.md).
- If this is an update to an already published plugin, your users can now update to the latest version.

## Use standard-version to automatically tag your release

You can also use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to apply the tags automatically based on the commits you made.

standard-version uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to add consistency to your commits, and to generate a `CHANGELOG.md` file automatically from your commits. For example:

- If your commit message starts with `fix:`, it bumps the patch version.
- If your commit message starts with `feat:`, it bumps the minor version.
- If the third line of your commit message starts with `BREAKING CHANGE:`, it bumps the major version.

:::tip
If you're using Visual Studio Code, the [Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) extension helps you to create Conventional Commits.
:::

To enable standard-version for your plugin:

1. Install standard-version.

   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm install --save-dev standard-version
   ```

2. In `package.json`, add the following properties:

   ```json title="package.json"
   {
     "scripts": {
       "release": "standard-version"
     },
     "standard-version": {
       "t": ""
     }
   }
   ```

   - `"t": ""` configures standard-version to remove the default `v` prefix to adhere to Obsidian's guidelines.

To make a release:

1. Commit your changes according to Conventional Commits.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add settings"
   ```

1. Create a release and update the changelog.

   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm run release
   ```

   :::note
   By default, if the major version is below **1**, for example in 0.3.4, `feat:` and `BREAKING CHANGE:` bump the patch and minor versions, respectively, rather than the minor and major versions. To bump the minor and major version:

   ```bash npm2yarn
   # Release as minor
   npm run release -- --release-as minor
   # Release as major
   npm run release -- --release-as major
   ```

   :::

1. Push the new tag to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push --follow-tags origin main
   ```

   - `main` is the name of the remote branch you want to push to.

GitHub builds and releases the plugin using GitHub Actions.
