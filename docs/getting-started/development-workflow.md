# Development workflow

Whenever you make a change to the plugin source code, the plugin needs to be reloaded. You can reload the plugin by quitting Obsidian and starting it again, but that gets tiring quickly.

## Reload plugin inside Obsidian

You can reload the plugin by re-enabling it in the list of installed plugins:

1. Open **Preferences**.
2. Click **Community plugins**.
3. Find your plugin under **Installed plugins**.
4. Toggle the switch off to disable the plugin.
5. Toggle the switch on to enable the plugin.

You're now running the updated version of your plugin.

## Reload plugin on file changes

The [Hot-Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin reloads your plugin whenever the source code changes.
