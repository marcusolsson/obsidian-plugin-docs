# React

In this guide, you'll configure your plugin to use [React](https://reactjs.org/). It assumes that you already have a plugin with a [custom view](../user-interface/views.md) that you want to convert to use React.

While you don't need to use a separate framework to build a plugin, there are a few reasons why you'd want to use React:

- You have existing experience of React and want to use a familiar technology.
- You have existing React components that you want to reuse in your plugin.
- Your plugin requires complex state management or other features that can be cumbersome to implement with regular [HTML element](../user-interface/html-elements.md).

## Configure your plugin

1. Add React to your plugin dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

1. Add type definitions for React:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

1. In `tsconfig.json`, enable JSX support on the `compilerOptions` object:

   ```ts title="tsconfig.json"
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "jsx": "react"
     }
   }
   ```

## Create a React component

Create a new file called `ReactView.tsx` in the plugin root directory, with the following content:

```tsx title="ReactView.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

export const ReactView = () => {
  return <h4>Hello, React!</h4>;
};
```

## Mount the React component

To use the React component, it needs to be mounted on a [HTML element](../user-interface/html-elements.md). The following example mounts the `ReactView` component on the `this.containerEl.children[1]` element:

```tsx title="view.tsx"
import { ItemView, WorkspaceLeaf } from "obsidian";
// highlight-start
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
// highlight-end
import { ReactView } from "./ReactView";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const VIEW_TYPE_EXAMPLE = "example-view";

class ExampleView extends ItemView {
  constructor(leaf: WorkspaceLeaf) {
    super(leaf);
  }

  getViewType() {
    return VIEW_TYPE_EXAMPLE;
  }

  getDisplayText() {
    return "Example view";
  }

  async onOpen() {
    // highlight-start
    const root = createRoot(this.containerEl.children[1]);
    root.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <ReactView />,
      </React.StrictMode>
    );
    // highlight-end
  }

  async onClose() {
    // highlight-next-line
    ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(this.containerEl.children[1]);
  }
}
```

For more information on `ReactDOM.render()` and `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()`, refer to the documentation on [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html).

You can mount your React component on any `HTMLElement`, for example [status bar items](../user-interface/status-bar.md). Just make sure to clean up properly by calling `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()` when you're done.

## Create an App context

If you want to access the [`App`](../reference/typescript/classes/App.md) object from one of your React components, you need to pass it as a dependency. As your plugin grows, even though you're only using the `App` object in a few places, you start passing it through the whole component tree.

Another alternative is to create a React context for the app to make it globally available to all components inside your React view.

1. Use `React.createContext()` to create a new app context.

   ```tsx title="context.ts"
   import * as React from "react";
   import { App } from 'obsidian';

   export const AppContext = React.createContext<App>({} as App);
   ```

1. Wrap the `ReactView` with a context provider and pass the app as the value.

   ```tsx title="view.tsx"
   const root = createRoot(this.containerEl.children[1]);
   root.render(
     <AppContext.Provider value={this.app}>
       <ReactView />
     </AppContext.Provider>,
     this.containerEl.children[1]
   );
   ```

1. Create a custom hook to make it easier to use the context in your components.

   ```tsx title="hooks.ts"
   import { AppContext } from "./context";

   export const useApp = (): App | undefined => {
     return React.useContext(AppContext);
   };
   ```

1. Use the hook in any React component within `ReactView` to access the app.

   ```tsx title="ReactView.tsx"
   import * as React from "react";
   import { useApp } from "./hooks";

   export const ReactView = () => {
     const { vault } = useApp();

     return <h4>{vault.getName()}</h4>;
   };
   ```

For more information, refer to the React documentation for [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [Building Your Own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).
